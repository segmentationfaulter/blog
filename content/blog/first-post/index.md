description: "Very first blog post"
---

This is the very first blog post I am writing. The basic idea was to write down anything significant what I learn while I am reading [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). I have heard a lot of good stuff about this book, would try to watch the accompanying [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090) as well if I could get enough time to watch them. Writing everything down what I learn will hopefully bring more clarity to my thought process, it would also serve as a learning journal of my own, which I would be able to refer to in future.
